TwitchViewer + [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/index.html) + Twitch = Love

TwitchViewer is a little User Interface that connects to [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/index.html) to search for streams on twitch.tv and let’s you easily open them in VLC.

## Setup

First install [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/index.html) and VLC (if you don't have it) then download our precompiled binary for your platform and execute it. Done.
